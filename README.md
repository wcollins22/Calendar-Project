# Unit-Project-6

## What Is This?
We made a calendar that allows you to schedule events and even get the current weather forecast. Our main inspiration was making something you could use and something professional.

## What Did We Use?
We used the built-in Javascript date api. It offered the ability to get the current date and also calculate the upcoming dates. 

## Problems We Faced
There was a lot of complicated math and we ran into some issues with our styling.

## Conclusion
We would like to add notifications to remind when you have something to do and localized weather so you can see the weather for your town, not just Water Valley.
